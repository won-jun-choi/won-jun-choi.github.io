Hi, I am Wonjun from South Korea. I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Emory University. Before joining Emory, I earned Masters in Economics and B.S. in mathematics and economics from Korea University.

My research interest lies broadly in the field of micro-econometrics and treatment effect analysis.
